Set-up

Have some patience when you first start out and try to follow these 
simple steps...

1. Make sure you have the correct Java JRE Runtime installed for your
   Operating System. 
   If you're running Windows x64 use Java for x64, not the x86
   version, and it's running properly.

2. This version requires MySQL 5.5 or later installed and configured
   properly. A Schema must be created and Users Permissions also set
   correctly. 

3. Fire-up unicenta oPOS and head straight for the Configuration 
   panel. Settings are here for everything from Databases through to
   Printers.

4. Set Roles and Users - we've already created four for you.
   If you set a Password for the Administrator account. Make sure you
   remember it!

   uniCenta oPOS comes with two Rate types already created: Exempt
   and Standard. Have as many as you want.

6. Create Categories. Use Categories to group your Products.
   This controls your Sales screen button layout. A default 
   Category is already there. Category Standard
   You can rename it and go on to create as many as you need.

   uniCenta oPOS you need to get right.

   button images and fancy looking text.

   to choose from.

   layout before you start.

   to other systems.
